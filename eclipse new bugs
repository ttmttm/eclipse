Console missing or not showing text
Right click on in console -> Preferences... -> check Fixed width console. Now you have auto word wrap and everything shows ok. 
Seems like Eclipse console have a limit on number of characters displayed in one line.

Eclipse does not highlight matching variables
Window -> Preferences -> Java -> Editor -> Mark Occurrences
Select all options available there.
Also go to:
Preferences > General > Editors > Text Editors > Annotations
Compare the settings for 'Occurrences' and 'Write Occurrences'
Make sure that you don't have the 'Text as higlighted' option checked for one of them.
